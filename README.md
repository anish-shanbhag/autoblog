# Cryogen

Cryogen is a software platform that makes sharing your dynamically generated code easier than ever, bridging the disconnect between coding tutorials/documentation sites and your own codebase.

- Define steps for creating a project Template or transforming an existing codebase with an intuitive visual Recipe builder
- Integrate directly with VS Code to modify local code and highlight what's changing in real time
- Create highly interactive articles and tutorials that evolve as you scroll
- Hook into a suite of codemod APIs for limitless customization
- Integrate with the GitHub and NPM ecosystems for easy distribution of your Recipes

# In Development

Cryogen is currently in development. Stay tuned for a beta release in the near future.
